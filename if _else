ðŸ“Œ Question

Write a Verilog module top_module that implements the following behavior:

The computer must shut down if the cpu_overheated signal is high.

Output: shut_off_computer = 1

Otherwise, keep it 0.

The car should keep driving if it has not yet arrived and the gas tank is not empty.

Output: keep_driving = 1

If the car has arrived, or the gas tank is empty, then keep_driving = 0.

Ports:

Inputs:

cpu_overheated (1 = overheated, 0 = normal)

arrived (1 = destination reached, 0 = still traveling)

gas_tank_empty (1 = empty, 0 = fuel available)

Outputs:

shut_off_computer (active high)

keep_driving (active high)


Logic in ease
module top_module (
    input      cpu_overheated,   // 1 if overheated
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,          // 1 if destination reached
    input      gas_tank_empty,   // 1 if empty
    output reg keep_driving
);

    // Shut down computer if overheated
    always @(*) begin
        if (cpu_overheated)
            shut_off_computer = 1'b1;
        else 
            shut_off_computer = 1'b0;
    end
    
    // Keep driving if not arrived AND fuel available
    always @(*) begin
        if (arrived == 1'b0 && gas_tank_empty == 1'b0)
            keep_driving = 1'b1;
        else 
            keep_driving = 1'b0;
    end

endmodule
