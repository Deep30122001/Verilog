You are given a four-bit input vector in[3:0]. We want to know some relationships between each bit and its neighbour:
out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left (higher index) are '1'. For example, out_both[2] should indicate if in[2] and in[3] are both 1.
Since in[3] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[3].
out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'.
For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1. Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_any[0].
out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left. For example, out_different[2] should indicate if in[2] is different from in[3].
For this part, treat the vector as wrapping around, so in[3]'s neighbour to the left is in[0].

The most robust and readable way to implement this logic is by using continuous assignments (assign). This is the best practice for this type of simple combinatorial logic where outputs are a direct function of inputs.

Alternatively, if you must use a loop, a generate block is the correct syntax for loop-based assignments that define hardware structure.

1. Corrected Code Using Continuous Assignments (Recommended)

This approach is the simplest and most common for this kind of logic. It is clean, direct, and avoids the complexities of procedural blocks.
Verilog

module top_module( 
    input [3:0] in,
    output [2:0] out_both,
    output [3:1] out_any,
    output [3:0] out_different
);

    // out_both: AND with neighbor to the left (higher index)
    assign out_both[0] = in[1] & in[0];
    assign out_both[1] = in[2] & in[1];
    assign out_both[2] = in[3] & in[2];

    // out_any: OR with neighbor to the right (lower index)
    assign out_any[1] = in[1] | in[0];
    assign out_any[2] = in[2] | in[1];
    assign out_any[3] = in[3] | in[2];

    // out_different: XOR with neighbor to the left, with wrap-around
    assign out_different[0] = in[0] ^ in[1];
    assign out_different[1] = in[1] ^ in[2];
    assign out_different[2] = in[2] ^ in[3];
    assign out_different[3] = in[3] ^ in[0];
    
endmodule

USING GENERATE:-

module top_module( 
    input [3:0] in,
    output [2:0] out_both,
    output [3:1] out_any,
    output [3:0] out_different );
   
    genvar i;
    generate
        for (i = 0; i < 3; i = i + 1) begin : gen_outputs
            assign out_both[i] = in[i+1] & in[i];
            assign out_any[i+1] = in[i+1] | in[i];
            assign out_different[i] = in[i] ^ in[i+1];
        end
    endgenerate

    // Separate assignment for the wrap-around case
    assign out_different[3] = in[3] ^ in[0];
                    
            
endmodule
